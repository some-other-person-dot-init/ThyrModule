This plugin is made for experiments with Bukkit API and other stuff.

This soon will be integrated into another plugin, which is developed specifically for certain server.

What does it contain so far?
----------------------------
- Test command with drop forbiddance switch specifically for sender
- Resource manipulation protocols (so far only "ore->stone" is ready) with 3 different algorithms!

Requirements
------------
- Java 11 or later
- Minecraft server with Spigot 1.16.5 (unknown functionality with other versions)
- World named PotolotCraft (main resource protocols work only there)
- Denizen

Build
-----
To build it by your own you will need Maven and Java 11+.

Plans
-----
I don't know, if I will ever touch this plugin after integrating it into Potolotcraft plugin, so the current future of this is hazy.
